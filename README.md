## 💡 **Algorithms and Data Structures**

### **AVL Tree**
This app uses an **AVL Tree** to manage products. The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring that each operation (insert, update, search) takes O(log n) time.

#### **AVL Tree Operations**
- **Insert**: Adds a product by its ID and automatically balances the tree.
- **Search**: Efficiently retrieves a product by ID.
- **Update**: Locates the product and modifies the necessary fields.
- **In-Order Traversal**: Retrieves products sorted by ID.

#### **Rotations**
- **Left Rotation**: Balances when the right subtree is heavier.
- **Right Rotation**: Balances when the left subtree is heavier.
- **Left-Right Rotation**: Balances more complex cases when both left and right subtrees are imbalanced.
